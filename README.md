Theo Servedio is currently a Clinical Research Coordinator for the [PREDiCTOR Study](https://impact-mh.org/awardees/predictor/) and the Multimodal Insights into Neuopsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University in May 2024 with a B.A. in Psychology and a concentration in Economics. During his time at Columbia, Theo worked as a Research Assistant in the [Laboratory for Intergroup Relations and the Social Mind](https://www.lirsm.psychology.columbia.edu), researching social identity threat, intergroup dynamics, and DEI in the workplace and in achievement contexts.

Theo is highly interested in furthering implementation research that bridges novel scientific findings with scalable clinical applications. In particular, Theo wants to study mood and anxiety disorders, with a targeted interest in using behavioral data to identify predictors of both the onset of Bipolar Disorder in CHR-BD populations and mood switches in individuals with Bipolar Disorder. Theo plans to attend graduate school to pursue a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology in the future.
