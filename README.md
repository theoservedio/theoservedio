Theo is highly interested in furthering implementation research that bridges novel scientific findings with scalable clinical applications. In particular, Theo has a targeted interest in using behavioral markers and biomarker to predict both onset and recurrence of mood disorders, and additionally wants to research how interventional care can be scaled to maximize patient engagement and treatment adherence. Theo plans to attend graduate school to pursue a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology in the future.
